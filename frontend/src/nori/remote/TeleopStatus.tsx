// is the pose at DAEMON START (startup-relative until stall-homing lands). The Pi OMITS the

// never calibrated) — render as "unknown".
//
// SETUP ASSUMPTION (2026-07-03): the arms are ALWAYS parked at the TOP of the rails at
// daemon start, so boot pose (h≈0) IS the top and the carriage can only ever travel DOWN.

// happens). We render a TOP-ANCHORED descent gauge: empty at the top (home), filling as the
// rail dives.
//

// direction is calibrated per unit (lift.hpp) and the Pi publishes depth-below-top directly —
// so railReading() clamps instead of mirroring, and a backwards rail now shows up as an
// obviously-pinned gauge rather than a plausible wrong number. See rail.ts.
